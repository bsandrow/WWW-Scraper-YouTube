Maybe need to add appropriate in-module error-checking for the case when the
accessor functions are called before a page is parsed with parse()
--
Look over the module documentation and make sure it's ok
--
Add versioning (and a --version) to the getyt and getyt-gui scripts
--
Maybe add a '--quiet' option to getyt to turn off all of the output
